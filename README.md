This package provides a suite of tools to work with SurveyMonkey surveys.

You can:

* Create and upload a survey from a **questionnaire** document.
* Browse and **download** surveys in your account.
* Conduct basic **analysis** (e.g. margin of error) on your surveys.
* Create statistical survey **weights** (via raking) to better represent a target population.
* Create presentable SurveyMonkey-style **banners** for polls.
